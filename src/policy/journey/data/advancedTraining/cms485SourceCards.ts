Our objective today is to understand how this Plan of Care directly connects to both our payment and our survey outcomes. Defensible Plan of Care documentation is absolutely critical. It supports our clinicians\' decision-making in the field, ensures patient safety, and maintains our reimbursement integrity. When the narrative is clear, everything flows smoothly. However, when Plan of Care content is weak, vague, or inconsistent, it becomes a primary root cause of denied claims and condition-level survey findings.',
      'From an auditor\'s perspective, the expectation is simple but rigorous: they are looking for one coherent, unbroken story from the initial certification right through to the final claim. If the story on the CMS-485 doesn\'t match the care delivered, the claim is at risk. By the end of this module, you\'ll know how to build that coherent, defensible story every single time.',
